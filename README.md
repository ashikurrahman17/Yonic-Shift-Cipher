# Yonic-Shift-Cipher
A custom symmetric encryption algorithm that independently shifts vowels and consonants with position-based dynamic keys. Featuring multi-rounds and case preservation, this cipher offers a playful yet interesting approach to text encryption, inspired by shift-based cryptography with added complexity.
